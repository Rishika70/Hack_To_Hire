# Question Answering with Transformer Models

This project explores the use of transformer models for question answering tasks. We experiment with three different models: BERT, GPT-2, and T5, fine-tuning them on a dataset of question-answer pairs.

## Data

The code assumes a DataFrame `df` containing question-answer pairs. The source of this data is not specified in the provided code.

## Preprocessing

A `preprocess_function` is defined to convert text to lowercase and tokenize it using a BERT tokenizer. This prepares the data for input to the models.

## Models

### BERT

BERT is fine-tuned for sequence classification, presumably to predict whether a given answer is correct for a given question.

### GPT-2

A custom `GPT2ForSequenceClassification` class is defined to adapt GPT-2 for sequence classification.

### T5

Special tokens are added to the T5 tokenizer, and the model's embedding layer is resized accordingly. A `generate_answer` function is defined to generate answers using T5.

## Training and Evaluation

### Training

The BERT and GPT-2 models are trained using a cross-entropy loss function and an AdamW optimizer.

### Evaluation

* **Accuracy** and **F1-score** are used to evaluate the performance of BERT and GPT-2.
* **BLEU score** is used to evaluate the quality of answers generated by T5.

## Data Visualization

* **Histograms** are used to visualize the distribution of question and answer lengths.
* **Word Clouds** are used to visualize the most frequent words in questions and answers.

## Proposed Improvements

### Enhanced Preprocessing

* Advanced cleaning (handling contractions, slang)
* Part-of-speech tagging
* Named entity recognition

### Advanced Model Architectures

* Different BERT variants (RoBERTa, DistilBERT)
* Ensemble methods

### Fine-tuning Strategies

* Hyperparameter optimization
* Layer-wise learning rate decay

### Evaluation Metrics

* ROUGE score
* Human evaluations

### Data Augmentation

* Paraphrasing
* Backtranslation

### Handling Imbalanced Data

* Oversampling/undersampling
* Weighted loss functions

### Interpretability and Explainability

* Attention visualization
* Feature importance analysis

### Deployment and Optimization

* Quantization
* Pruning
