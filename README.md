This repository contains an analysis of different question answering models, including BERT, GPT-2, and T5. The models are evaluated on various metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, BLEU score, and ROUGE score.

## Models

### BERT

- Fine-tuned BERT for sequence classification.
- Achieved [insert accuracy and F1 score].

### GPT-2

- Implemented a custom GPT-2 model for sequence classification.
- Achieved [insert accuracy and F1 score].
- BLEU scores for generated answers: [insert BLEU scores].

### T5

- Fine-tuned T5 for conditional generation.
- Achieved [insert ROUGE scores].

## Data

- The models were trained and evaluated on a dataset of [describe the dataset].

## Evaluation

- **Accuracy:** Measures the percentage of correctly classified answers.
- **F1 Score:** A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced evaluation.
- **BLEU Score:** Evaluates the quality of generated text by comparing it to reference answers.
- **ROUGE Score:** Assesses the overlap between generated summaries and reference summaries.

## Visualization

- Bar charts and box plots are used to visualize the performance of the models.

## Model Improvement

- Potential improvements include:
    - Enhanced preprocessing (e.g., advanced cleaning, POS tagging, NER).
    - Advanced model architectures (e.g., BERT variations, ensemble methods).
    - Fine-tuning strategies (e.g., hyperparameter optimization, layer-wise learning rate decay).
    - Evaluation metrics (e.g., human evaluation).
    - Data augmentation (e.g., paraphrasing, backtranslation).
    - Handling imbalanced data (e.g., oversampling/undersampling, weighted loss function).
    - Interpretability and explainability (e.g., attention visualization, feature importance analysis).
    - Deployment and optimization (e.g., quantization, pruning).

## Conclusion

- This analysis provides insights into the performance of different question answering models.
- The results can be used to guide the selection and improvement of models for specific question answering tasks.
